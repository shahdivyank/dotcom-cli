# webdiv-cli

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.js

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.26. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.

# IMPORTANT

- to use locally, run `sudo bun link` and then in another test repo or anywhere honestly, you can run `dotcom init <project name>` and it should be working as well as `dotcom run dev`
